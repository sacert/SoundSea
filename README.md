##### Play Song:
   - Hit the play button on the bottom left of the album art
   - Hit again to pause the song
   - If changed song from list, pause and start the song again to play the current song in the list

##### Working on:
   - Cleaning up code - as of right now there are a ton of global variables that I want to remove and lines of code that are called multiple times, it is best to make functions out of them
   - Bug fixing - need to play around with it more for certain bugs to pop up
   - Tighten the searching algorithm
